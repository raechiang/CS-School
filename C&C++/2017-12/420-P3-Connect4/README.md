# Connect 4 Game Using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project uses the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to play Connect 4. I would recommend reading the <a href="https://github.com/raechiang/CS-School/blob/master/C%26C%2B%2B/2017-12/420-P3-Connect4/chiang-rachel-project-report.pdf">project report</a> for a more in-depth overview.

## Getting Started

To compile on Windows, input
```
g++ -o <name> <list of .cpp files> -std=c++11
```
Or whatever compiler you use. Then run "<name>.exe"
Example input:
```
g++ -o fourlines Main.cpp AgentComputer.cpp Board.cpp Engine.cpp Node.cpp UserInterface.cpp -std=c++11
```
I have included an .exe.
