# Finding Roots
This project implements five numerical methods for finding roots of non-linear equations: Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant, False-Position, and Modified Secant. This project includes a <a href="https://github.com/raechiang/CS-School/blob/master/C%26C%2B%2B/2017-11/301-P2-Roots/rchiang-project-report.pdf">report</a>, which provides short descriptions of each method, tables approximating the roots, comparisons of the methods, and implementation details.
