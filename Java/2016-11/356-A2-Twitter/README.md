# Mini Twitter
In this assignment, students are to simulate a mini, desktop Twitter with a GUI using Java Swing. This assignment is meant to educate the students in implementing the following four design patterns:
<ol>
  <li>Singleton - only one instance of the class may exist</li>
  <li>Observer - for a one-to-many dependency, so that when one object (a subject changes, its observers are notified and updated automatically</li>
  <li>Visitor - for operating on different elements of an object hierarchy</li>
  <li>Composite - for treating objects uniformly by creating part-whole hierarchies</li>
</ol>
