# Hashing

This project requires the student to create a hash table that stores a String, which serves as the key, and a few numerical values. The hash table is an array that stores Entries, handling collisions with separate chaining. I used polynomial hashing (`hash = a * hash + key.charAt(i)`) to find the hash value but with an alteration such that if the index (placement) is even, a is equal to 33; otherwise, a is equal to 37. I then simply compressed the hash value by taking the absolute value result of the hash value mod the capacity. The rehash method is triggered when the number of entries contained in the hash table is equal to or exceeds the threshold, which is the product of the maximum capacity of the table and the load factor; the load factor is set to 0.75, or 75% of the length of the table. A new table is generated, which requires a transferal of all of the old values already existing in the old table. The old table is traversed, stopping wherever an Entry or a chain of Entries exists, compressing the Entries’ saved hash values according to the new table’s size to find their new index, and moving the Entry or chain to the appropriate bucket in the new table. Subsequently, the threshold is increased, using the same load factor to multiply with the new size. I set the initial capacity to 43, the size to 0, the threshold to 30, the collisions to 0, and the load factor to 0.75.
