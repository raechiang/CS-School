# Process Scheduler
This project involves simulating some process scheduling algorithms on lists of processes which are provided in a file through the command line. There is the first-come, first-serve algorithm, which (as its name implies) simply  runs each process in the order that they are found in the file. The shortest first scheduler executes the processes in order of those taking the least amount of cycles to those taking the most amount of cycles. If processes are the same length, they are executed first-come, first-serve. The round robin scheduler runs through the processes in order of submission, giving each a fair amount of time (called the quantum). If a process is not finished, it gets re-added to the queue and the cycle repeats. As the name suggests, the random scheduler randomly selects a process to run with a specified quantum. Similar to the round robin, the process will be thrown back into the drawing hat to be randomly selected again. However, it is not entirely random, as certain processes have higher chances of winning than others.
