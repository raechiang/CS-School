# iVote Simulator
This console-based iVote simulator supports two question types: single choice and multiple choices. The question, its type, and the answers all can be configured by the user. I have also provided a little demo.

In this project, I attempt to follow these OOP principles:
<ol>
  <li>Keep things as private as possible;</li>
  <li>Use appropriate Accessors, which corresponds with principle 1;</li>
  <li>Prefer interfaces though it is case-dependent;</li>
  <li>User Interfaces over Switches; and</li>
  <li>Consider Composition over Inheritance.</li>
</ol>
