/**
 * This program connects to a server codebank.xyz on port 38103. The first Byte
 * that it reads corresponds to the number of Bytes that is to be saved into an
 * array. After reading the whole array, we calculate the checksum of the array
 * of Bytes, using the method {@link #checksum(byte[])}. Once it has been
 * calculated, the client will send the checksum as a sequence of two Bytes back
 * to the server. If the server responds 1, then the checksum was calculated
 * correctly; otherwise, it will respond with a 0.
