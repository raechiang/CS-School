/**
 * This class simply connects to codebank.xyz through port number 38102. The
 * server sends 200 Bytes, which are supposed to each by "half bytes" and thus
 * two bytes are to be combined into one byte. After aggregating the 100 bytes,
 * it uses Java's CRC32 and checksum to generate an error-detecting code, which
 * is sent back to the server in a sequence of four bytes. If the server
 * constructed the same bytes as the program, the server will respond with a 1.
 * Otherwise, it responds with a 0.
