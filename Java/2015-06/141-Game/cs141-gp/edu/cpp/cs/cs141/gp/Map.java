 *
 * The purpose of this game is to test our ability to use object-oriented
 * programming. The game consists of multiple classes that make up the
 * different aspects incorporated. Within them are the different behaviors
 * (methods) and attributes (fields) that make up each class. This includes 
 * ActiveAgent, Briefcase, Enemy, GameEngine, Map, Player, PowerUp, and
 * UserInterface. The class ActiveAgent adjusts the positions when directed.
 * The Briefcase class determines where the briefcase will be placed. The
 * Enemy class places the enemies and stabs the player when it comes close,
 * and it contains Pursuit Mode during which enemies follow the player and
 * it is activated when Hard Mode is on. The GameEngine contains all of the
 * essentials to run the game itself. The Map keeps track of the positions
 * of the Player, Enemies, and Briefcase. The Player class keeps track of
 * the player's lives as well as the ammo. The PowerUp class contains the
 * invincibility, radar, and ammo. Lastly, the UserInterface contains all
 * menus and interaction with the operator.
