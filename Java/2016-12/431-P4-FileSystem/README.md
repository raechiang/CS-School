# File System
This program simulates a file system with 64 blocks. It requires three data structures for the allocation table (an integer array), the i-nodes (a list), and the bitmap (a long).

The user is able to input one of four commands to modify or read about the system:
<ol>
<li>put name,size;</li>
<li>del name;</li>
<li>bitmap; and</li>
<li>inodes.</li>
